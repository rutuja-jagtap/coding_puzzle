 The Goal
Destroy the mountains before your starship collides with one of them. For that, shoot the highest mountain on your path.
 	Rules
At the start of each game turn, you are given the height of the 8 mountains from left to right.
By the end of the game turn, you must fire on the highest mountain by outputting its index (from 0 to 7).

Firing on a mountain will only destroy part of it, reducing its height. Your ship descends after each pass.  

*Game Input
Within an infinite loop, read the heights of the mountains from the standard input and print to the standard output the index of the mountain to shoot.
Input for one game turn
8 lines: one integer mountainH per line. Each represents the height of one mountain given in the order of their index (from 0 to 7).
Output for one game turn
A single line with one integer for the index of which mountain to shoot.
